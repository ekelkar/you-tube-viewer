# You Tube Viewer

This project is based on the Pratical JavaScript with jQuery course presented by the Girl Develop It Atlanta chapter. The class was held on April 29, 2017 and taught by Matt Dominioni.

The project creates a page that uses the YouTube API to search for and play videos.

## Page Layout

The page created has a navbar on top with an field to input the search term and initiate the search. A list of matching videos is displayed as cards. Clicking on the card creates an under the navbar where the video can be watched.
